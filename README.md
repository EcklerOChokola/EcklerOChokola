### Hi there :wave:

I'm a french CS engineering student, and this profile is for my side projects. It will mostly contain my works for events and for simple tasks automations.

Even though I will mostly do Node.js in my spare time, I am open to collaborate on all types of projects, going from Assembly language to ML in Python.

 - I am currently taking part to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), and working on a Gmail/Discord integration (private).

I may post my private GitLab repositories once I finish studying :eyes:

At school, my current projects are : 
 - Development of a website to play Sudoku with friends (front-end in Angular, back-end in Java with Spring-boot)
 - Design of an haptic device to help people with visual impairment to navigate in a virtual space (haptic device made with 3D-printing and vibrating motors, everything else managed by Unity)
 - Development of two extensions for VSCode : one for LambdaProLog ([compiled implementation from IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/lande/ridoux/LPAZ/lpaz_html.html)), the other for EPF integrated in DocRead ([here in french](https://www-intuidoc.irisa.fr/docread-generateur-automatique-de-systemes-de-reconnaissance-de-documents-structures/))
 - Design and implementation of an image computing pipeline to classify hand-drawn symbols from accident documents (using Open-CV in C++)

My past projects are : 
 - Development of a guitar-studying web app with Angular
 - Design of an autonomous robot capable of following lines and grabbing/dispensing of objects in specified areas (ROS C++)
 - Development of a text-documents indexing and search engine in Python
 
I have also studied Assembly language for ARM-32 processors, C, R and computer theory.

If you have questions, don't hesitate to DM me on Twitter @EcklerOChokola. I speak French, German and English :blush:
